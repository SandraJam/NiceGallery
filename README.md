The architecture:

// PLAN ARCHITECTURE


Differences with a "big clean architecture":
I deleted the Controller: in this case it was only boilerplate.
For the same reason, I didn't create a class or a function for the thread change (or here, coroutine).

The code is tested with Unit tests adn full Kotlin.
